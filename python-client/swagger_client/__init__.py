    kinto

    Kinto is a minimalist JSON storage service with synchronisation and sharing abilities. It is meant to be easy to use and easy to self-host.  **Limitations of this OpenAPI specification:**   1. Validation on OR clauses is not supported (e.g. provide `data` or `permissions`   in patch operations).   2. [Filtering](http://kinto.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/1.x/filtering.html)   is supported on any field by using `?{prefix}{field_name}={value}`.   3. [Backoff headers](http://kinto.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/1.x/backoff.html)   may occur with any response, but they are only present if the server is under   in heavy load, so we cannot validate them on every request. They are listed only   on the default error message.   4. [Collection schemas](http://kinto.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/1.x/collections.html#collection-json-schema)   can be provided when defining a collection, but they are not validated by   this specification.
